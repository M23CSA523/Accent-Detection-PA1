# Speech Understanding Programming Assignment – 1 Report

## 1. Introduction

This project addresses two important areas in speech processing: Accent Detection and Spectrogram Analysis using various windowing techniques. The assignment is divided into two parts:

- **Part I – Accent Detection (Group Assignment):**  
  This section includes an in-depth analysis of accent detection, covering its importance, current approaches (both traditional and deep learning methods), evaluation metrics, and challenges. A PyTorch-based CNN implementation is provided as a benchmark.

- **Part II – Spectrogram Analysis and Windowing Techniques (Individual Assignment):**  
  This part involves experiments with the UrbanSound8K dataset to explore different windowing functions (Hann, Hamming, and Rectangular) for the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Additionally, it includes a comparative analysis of spectrograms for four songs from different genres and the implementation of a simple classifier based on these features.

## 2. Accent Detection

### 2.1 Importance and Applications

Accent detection plays a crucial role in many applications:
- **Speech Recognition:** Enhances recognition accuracy by accommodating diverse accent patterns.
- **Personal Assistants and Customer Service:** Tailors interactions based on the speaker's accent.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Assists in speaker identification and profiling.
- **Language Learning:** Provides feedback on pronunciation to help users improve their accents.

### 2.2 Current Approaches

#### Traditional Methods
- **Feature Extraction:** Techniques such as MFCCs, prosodic features, and other acoustic features.
- **Classification Models:** Methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
- **Pros & Cons:**  
  - Pros: Simplicity, lower computational cost, and ease of interpretation.  
  - Cons: Less robust to noise, and heavy reliance on handcrafted features.

#### Deep Learning Methods
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Automatically learn feature representations from spectrograms.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs:** Model temporal dependencies in speech signals.
- **Transformer-based Models:** Utilize self-attention mechanisms for capturing long-range dependencies.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine CNNs and RNNs to leverage both spatial and temporal information.
- **End-to-End Systems:** Process raw audio, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

|   Method         |   Advantages                                          |   Limitations                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Traditional      | Simple and interpretable                              | Struggles in noisy conditions; requires manual features |
| CNNs             | High accuracy; automatic feature learning             | Requires large datasets; computationally intensive      |
| RNNs/LSTMs       | Effective for sequential data                         | Prone to vanishing gradients; slower training           |
| Transformers     | Excellent at modeling long-term dependencies          | Needs significant data and computing resources          |
| Hybrid Models    | Combines spatial and temporal modeling                | More complex and harder to tune                         |

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of accent detection models is typically evaluated using:
- **Accuracy:** The overall percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** To measure class-specific performance, especially in multi-class setups.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Provides insights into misclassification among accent classes.
- **ROC-AUC:** Useful for assessing performance in binary or one-vs-all scenarios.

### 2.4 Challenges and Future Directions

- **Data Diversity:** Limited and imbalanced accent datasets.
- **Variability:** High variability within the same accent class.
- **Robustness:** Dealing with noise and varying recording conditions.
- **Interpretability:** Explaining the decisions of deep learning models.
- **Real-time Processing:** Developing efficient models for deployment on edge devices.

### 2.5 Implementation Summary

A CNN-based accent detection system has been implemented using PyTorch. The system includes:
- A custom dataset loader that reads audio files and their labels.
- A CNN model that processes Mel-spectrogram representations of the audio.
- A training loop that utilizes cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
- The model is evaluated using standard metrics, and its performance is logged for further analysis.

## 3. Spectrogram Analysis and Windowing Techniques

### 3.1 UrbanSound8K Dataset Experiments

The UrbanSound8K dataset is used to explore the impact of different windowing functions on spectrogram generation. The following window types are applied:
- **Hann Window**
- **Hamming Window**
- **Rectangular Window**

Steps include:
- Computing the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) with each window.
- Generating log-scaled spectrograms.
- Saving and visually comparing the resulting spectrograms.

### 3.2 Comparative Analysis of Songs

Four songs from different genres (e.g., rock, classical, pop, and jazz) are analyzed. For each song:
- A spectrogram is generated using a selected window function.
- The time–frequency characteristics (such as harmonic content and transient features) are compared.
- Observations regarding the unique acoustic properties of each genre are documented.

### 3.3 Classifier Implementation

A simple CNN classifier is built using the spectrogram features from the UrbanSound8K dataset. This classifier serves to:
- Evaluate the quality of the features extracted using different windowing functions.
- Provide a quantitative measure (accuracy, loss) to compare the effectiveness of each windowing approach.

## 4. Results and Discussion

- **Accent Detection:**  
  The CNN model achieved competitive performance (exact metrics to be inserted after experimentation). Detailed results and confusion matrices are included to illustrate the model's effectiveness.

- **Spectrogram Analysis:**  
  Visual comparisons indicate that the Hann and Hamming windows tend to smooth the spectral content, while the Rectangular window shows more spectral leakage. The classifier’s performance further supports these observations.

- **Genre Analysis:**  
  The spectrograms reveal distinct patterns across genres. For instance, classical music tends to display sustained harmonic patterns, while rock music exhibits sharper transients.

## 5. Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to two significant problems in speech processing. The accent detection module demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to classify accents, while the spectrogram analysis section highlights the impact of different windowing techniques on feature extraction and classification performance. Future work could focus on enhancing model robustness and exploring more advanced architectures.
